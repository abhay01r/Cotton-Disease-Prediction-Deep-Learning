# Cotton-Disease-Prediction-Deep-Learning

Sure, here is a README for Cotton-Disease-Prediction-Deep-Learning:

**Overview**

This project uses deep learning to predict cotton diseases from images of cotton leaves. The project uses a pre-trained ResNet model, which is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that has been trained on a large dataset of images. The model is fine-tuned on a dataset of cotton leaf images, and is then able to predict the disease that is present in a new image with high accuracy.

**Motivation**

Cotton diseases can cause significant damage to cotton crops, and can lead to significant financial losses for farmers. Early detection of cotton diseases is important for preventing the spread of disease and minimizing crop losses. Deep learning can be used to develop accurate and automated systems for detecting cotton diseases, which can help farmers to protect their crops.

**Data Collection**

The data for this project was collected from the Indian AI Production dataset. The dataset contains images of cotton leaves with different diseases. The images were collected from farmers in India, and are labeled with the type of disease that is present in the image.

**Resnet(Transform Learning)**

ResNet is a deep CNN that has been shown to be very effective for image classification tasks. The model is made up of a stack of convolutional layers, and each layer learns to extract features from the input image. The model is able to learn very complex features from the images, which allows it to achieve high accuracy on image classification tasks.

**Installation and Run**

The project is implemented in Python, and uses the PyTorch deep learning library. The project can be installed by following the instructions in the README file. To run the project, you will need to download the Indian AI Production dataset and place it in the data directory. You can then run the main.py script to train and test the model.

**Deployement on AWS**

The model can be deployed on AWS using the SageMaker service. SageMaker provides a managed environment for training and deploying machine learning models. To deploy the model on SageMaker, you will need to create a SageMaker notebook instance and upload the project code to the notebook. You can then train the model on SageMaker and deploy it to a production endpoint.
